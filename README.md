Or add it in the scheduler

```php
    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('db:backup s3')->everyDay();
    }
```

And you're done, voila ðŸª„
